    <p>The first activity I completed this session was reviewing the Mozilla article on Accessibility. The article did a really great job with explaining exactly what accessibility is
      and why it’s so important to integrate in your website. It emphasized how equality is a major factor in this topic because every individual should be able to access a website
      regardless of a disability they might have. There are different types of disabilities that result in visual, hearing, cognitive, and motor impairments. They can affect users and
      how they interact with your site, possibly restricting them from interacting if your website isn’t accessible to them. For example, if your page has a lot of video content, deaf
      users won’t be able to hear and understand the content without transcripts or captions. Users with vision issues might not be able to read text without text to speech audio, or
      with bright contrasting colors that affect their color blindness. In conclusion, I learned a lot from this activity because I never realized how important accessibility was within 
      web design, and that its a necessity in order to include everybody regardless of impairments. 
 
      The second activity I completed was experimenting with various color schemes on Paletton. This was interesting to play around with schemes and finding out which colors correspond to
      others. In regards to accommodating to those with visual impairments like color blindness, I think a complementary scheme or an analogous scheme would be best. There isn’t too
      much strong contrast within those schemes so I would assume it would be easier for visually impaired individuals to read information with those colors that go together well. On
      the other hand I don’t think a monochromatic scheme would be successful, as it might be too dull or unreadable for the reader. </p>
