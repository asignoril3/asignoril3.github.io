    <p>The first activity I completed for Session 6: Communications, was the Tutorialspoint article on Internet Services. After reading through the tutorial, I learned all about the different Internet 
      services and the protocols taken that allow users to communicate. These services and protocols, such as VOIP, allow us to make calls with audio and video transmission, exchange
      and transfer files, etc. I also learned about P2P file sharing, where users can share and interact with different types of media such as movies, books, music, and more. In 
      the future, I can apply this information by being more aware in general of the how communication functions, and how we are able to share media and files on the internet with others.
      
    The second activity I completed was the overview of the RIAA: About Piracy article. In this article I learned a lot about copyrighted material, and the legal issues and penalties 
      for copying and sharing them without permission. In this article I learned about the different types of piracy regarding music theft, some examples being burning cds and distributing 
      them, stripping a video of its audio and adding it to your playlist through an app, and making an MP3 file of a song and sharing it to others. Copyright material must be
      authorized by its creators to be downloaded, streamed and shared. In the future, I will use this information to be aware of websites that might partake in piracy and exploit
      stolen content.</p>
