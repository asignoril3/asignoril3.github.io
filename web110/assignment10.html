    <p>This session, I learned about CSS and its purpose within creating and stylizing a web page. A CSS file is a file that could be used to control and change the appearance of 
      various files at once. Adding text, links, images, and other graphics while being able to customize their color and style is possible with CSS. While you could use CSS to mass
      edit files and their contents, the style HTML element could be individually used for a file to change something about that file specifically. In the future I will definitely use
      this information to add cool customizations my own website and manipulate the appearance to my liking.</p>
