    <p>This session I learned more about adding multi media graphics, images, audio and or video to my HTML web page. I learned about how to embed the files and how to manipulate
    the apperance. I did have trouble getting the image to appear as well as the audio disapearring on me. Upon practice and more research, using different types of media
    could definitely improve the quality of your web page especially if functionality is integrated in the design. In the future I will definitely use this information to learn more
    about how to display content I'm interested in on my web page and make it a unique experience for others to view and interact with. </p>
