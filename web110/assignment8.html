    <p>The first activity I completed in Session 8: Internet Security was the GCFLearnFree tutorial on Internet safety. In this article I learned about various types of ways to protect
      your personal data from malicious malware. Some examples are creating strong passwords and not sharing them with others, double checking urls, websites or emails if they’re legit,
      installing antivirus software or firewall, and to not enter or view personal data when connected to unsecure wifi networks. All of these tasks are a step further to securing your
      information to others who may be trying to hack you. The second article in this activity is the TutorialsPoint Article, in which talked about security protocols such as IPSec and
      SSL, that provide security against different threats like spam or phishing. It also touched on encryption, decryption, and digital signature to even further conceal, secure, and
      identify the sending and receiving of a message. In the future, I will definitely use this information to make sure I am safe on the internet by being aware of malicious sites
      trying to steal info. It also made me realize I have to be more aware of what I view on a public unsecure wifi networks and to make sure to not enter personal data.

The second assignment I completed for this session was researching password managers and multi factor authentication. Both of these are used to verify the true identity of a user by 
      asking questions, using passwords, fingerprints, etc. This made me think of google and how we have to have 2 step verification set up to verify our identity through another
      device or PIN number. I also thought of how users can scan their fingerprint or Face ID on their iPhone to view saved passwords. Regarding password managers, I learned more
      about google’s password manager and that it’s a secure way of storing your passwords online. I already had quite a few passwords saved in there. In the future, I will use this 
      information to recognize safe or unsafe password managers, and to set up multi factor authentication for certain things that need more security online.</p>
