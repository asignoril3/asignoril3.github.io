    <p>This session, I learned about databases and how data could be stored and accessed through a SQL. A SQL (Structured Query Language) is virtually used by every relational database
      system as their programming language for querying and maintaining the database. There are different statements and commands that will specify and return data tables or records
      pertaining to different info based on what statement is inserted. In he future I will use this information to apply to my own web page and manage data.</p>
