    <p>The first activity I completed for Session 7: Networking, was the tutorialspoint articles. The first tutorial was about
      Internet Reference models. I learned about how the standard networking models are important for users to communicate regardless
      of their device differences. There are 2 types of models, the TCP/IP and the OSI model- TCP/IP being more practical. Each models
      have different layers or protocols that contribute to its functionality. The second article focuses on Internet protocols like TCP,
      IP, and UDP, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, and HTTP. Overall I learned about the different types of protocols that are considered unreliable
      with unsuccessful data transmission, and the protocols that are considered reliable or connection oriented. I also learned that 
      some protocols rely on others to ensure data transmission or security, like TCP and IP. I also learned about how control and data
      information are separated. Protocols can be considered unreliable if it doesnâ€™t separate this information, like TFTP. Finally,
      the last article focused on the Internet Domain Name System. I learned about how this system helped clear up internet traffic
      and resolve large host files with an address. It also talked about IP addresses, domain names, urls, and how they could be used
      to identify different things such as an address for a host or a web address. In conclusion, I can use this information in the
      future to recognize non secure internet protocols, and identify different parts of a web domain or address. 

      The second activity I completed this session was researching the necessary components to set up an at home network. Upon my
      search I found a modem and a router are the main components that are needed. Ethernet cables are optional to connect devices.
      A modem gives you access to the internet, while the router lets you connect other devices and secure your connection. Wireless
      home network can be achieved with a signal through the router. This was interesting to learn about the different components
      and how they allow your devices to connect and access the internet. In the future I can apply this information to help me
      during the process of setting up a home network, and determine which components I may or may not need depending on the devices I
      want to connect.</p>
