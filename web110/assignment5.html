    <p>For session 5, social media, the first activity I completed was the TutorialsPoint: Social Networking tutorial. Based on the information provided
      about different social networking sites, the social media platform that interests me is LinkedIn. I think it’s a good opportunity for businesses
      or professional individuals to build a community online within their line of work. It’s beneficial for users to join groups, post images or text
      regarding ideas, projects, or to even view and apply for jobs. Others have stated that some users use LinkedIn as Facebook, to chat amongst others and 
      post about personal things, which I think defeats the intended professional environment, but besides this, I think LinkedIn is a great way to gain
      more professional connections and share/view what others are working on. In the future I will use this information when I finally decide to create
      a LinkedIn account to promote my business or work.

The second activity I completed was the Smart Insights Honeycomb model, in which I evaluated Instagram with. I believe that Instagram supports this
      framework. There are many accessible control settings for users to control and manipulate the privacy of their activity, identity/profile, who 
      can send them messages, groups that they can join and leave, and overall manage their account and what is shared on their page. There are also 
      many ways for users to share ideas and thoughts, such as image posts, story posts, and direct messages. This makes every users presence easy
      access and unique to them. Instagram also has safety policies for posts that aren’t considered appropriate, such as removing the harmful post
      or restricting the user. This ensures the instagram community is blocked from harmful posts. One social media platform that might not support 
      the honeycomb building blocks is Facebook. Facebook lacks strong data and identity privacy control, and scammers can easily make fake accounts.
      There are also limited features to customize your profile, and posting is only through text or image posts. In conclusion, I believe Instagram 
      supports the Honeycomb social media evaluation the best out of other social media. In the future I will use this information to evaluate any 
      new social media platforms I join to make sure the community is safe and private.</p>
