    <p>For Session 4: Email, the first activity I completed was the GCF Global and TutorialsPoint email tutorials. Upon reading through these
articles, I learned several new features and functions, protocols, history, and how email impacted society and standard paper mail. One specific
thing that I learned were regarding Gmail features that I did not know how to set up- like the signature feature or calendar. I didn’t realize there
were many ways to customize your interface and filter your inbox. I also learned about the protocols like SMTP,  IMAP, POP, and how they are a
standard to make sure email users can communicate. I was not aware of these protocols and found it interesting how they contribute to the 
functionality of using email. Lastly, I also learned the meaning and purpose of BCC, and how it’s used for a mass email that want to keep
recipients private. In the future, I will apply this information to use Gmail more efficiently and professionally. 


The second activity I completed was researching and considering mailing lists. I recognized that I am already signed up for different mail lists, 
mostly retail stores that send discounts and inform customers of upcoming sales. I wanted to sign up for an informative mail list that can notify 
me of diverse articles. Upon researching “news mail list” and “most popular newsletters”, I discovered the site “The Skimm”. I looked more into 
the articles and noticed that there were breaking news, articles specific to an individuals problem they want to help solve, or other smaller 
stories that you might not see on bigger newsletters that are still impactful. I liked how there is a fashion week and women’s category. 
I ended up subscribing for their Tuesdays and Thursdays newsletter about shopping and media. Regarding bulk email restrictions for mailing lists, 
I found that companies sending out bulk mail can only send 200-400 emails per day, per user, and up to 2,500 a month. This is so the sender will 
not go over their email domain limits, and prevent blacklisting/being cut off from sending bulk emails. In conclusion, from this activity about
mailing lists, I explored new mailing lists while learning about their limitations. It completely makes sense that there are limits but I wasn’t 
aware of the procedures taken place to ensure prevention of becoming spam or cut off. In the future I will use this information to sign up for 
mailing lists that will benefit me and make sure the sender is not a spammer or sends excessive emails.</p>
