    <p>This semester in Web110, I learned a lot about various aspects of the internet, ranging from surface level topics like email and search engines,
    to more in depth processes such as structuring HTML web pages and using basic programming languages like CSS. I learned how to make a basic web page containing text, images, videos, and graphics.
      The importance of different roles within web design were also emphasized to me during this course, like project management, maintaining databases, keeping track of security, 
      and more. I learned about the functionality behind the World Wide Web and how networking works amongst users. Overall, this semester, I became vastly more familiar 
      and understanding of how the internet functions and how website content is made, which I will definitely utilize in the future.</p>
