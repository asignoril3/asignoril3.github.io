    <p>The first activity I completed was about the topic of Chrome Browser help center and advanced settings. This informed me more about the customization features 
      Chrome has available, and how Chrome can assist us with various things, such as security, managing passwords, controlling privacy and data, customizing displays 
      such as fonts, light and dark mode, wallpapers, and more. I think these features are important to make sure each user can use Chrome in a way that fits their work
      or learning style. I utilize some of these features, such as having important sites bookmarked and added to my browser, changing the display of the home page to my liking,
      and storing passwords. 
The second activity I completed was about Safari’s resources and features. This informed me all about Safari’s features to customize your home page to make browsing easier, safe,
      and more accessible to your favorite sites. Something I learned during this activity is Safari’s privacy report feature. The feature informs you of trackers who were blocked 
      from tracking you visiting websites. Apple gives you the option of viewing a report, and managing your privacy by becoming more aware of sites you may visit, and prevent cross
      site tracking through device settings. </p>
