    <p>The activity I completed for session 16 was the IT Job Outlook and Preparation. A few job titles I looked at were Web/digital
      designer, Computer System Analysts, and Computer Support Specialists. I found that web designers alongside many other positions 
      listed, typically require a Bachelor’s degree as entry level education. There is usually no on the job training and might require
      several years of experience. Within my searches I also noticed a lot of work environments for IT workers are at home work
      environments which I liked. An entry level position that interests me is the Computer Support Specialist. The median pay for 2022 was 
      almost $60K per year, with no degree required, IT related certifications qualifying. I think this job is a good fit for people like me who are looking
      for an entry level position that will give them the experience they need for a higher up position. Another position that I would
      possibly aim for after my entry level job, is the Web Designer; median salary at $104k a year, requiring a Bachelors. In 
      conclusion, I learned a lot about different jobs and what I might be interested in, the experience levels they are best for, and what education level 
      I need to achieve. I will definitely use this information and the bls.gov site in the future to look more into job listings in other fields I’m 
      interested in like Graphic design. </p>
