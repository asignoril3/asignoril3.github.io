    <p>The topic that my final project will be based on is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). For the presentation I am planning on creating a Google slides powerpoint while recording my
      voice over to cover whatâ€™s on the slides and go more in depth. I will show screen shots demonstrating how CSS is formatted in HTML and integrated into files, as well as the
      different customizations you can get from different keyword values. Importance and history of CSS will be discussed. I will also explain how this ties into HTML and Javascript.
      

      From reading the resources and materials on Wikiversity, to learning how and attempting to create a Gantt chart, this session I learned a lot about project management and how it is
      extremely important in project planning and creating. A project manager has many different tasks and duties in order to ensure a project is carried out successfully. Some of
      those tasks include finances, resources, planning/scheduling, etc. Communication and reliability are some characteristics a good project manager has. Gantt charts are also a
      tool a project manager could use to keep track of dates, measure time and plan tasks, see data growth/change over time, etc. In the future I might use this information if I
      have a project to manage myself or keep track of data.</p>
