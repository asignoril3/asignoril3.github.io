    <p>Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask as search engines provide a wide variety of information, in many similar and different ways that others might prefer based on what they are 
      searching for. While completing activity 1, the objective was to search for “web search engine” and compare how extensive or informative the results
      are. Out of all of the search engines, I found that Google and Ask provided me with the most amount of results for most of my searches, exceeding 1.5 billion results. This already
      showed me that Google and Ask possess vasts amounts of information more than the others. As I completed the search, I noticed that all of them suggested related articles and 
      tables of information to the right of the page, which was useful to extend my search and branch off of results that interested me. Bing and Yahoo tended to have more interactive
      features about their user interface during my search, with different ways to display information with links, statistics relating to my search, and even a fun fact quiz which I 
      found interesting and fun. Within the search results, Bing also added articles that were only somewhat related to search engines, which was fine for just browsing, but if I was 
      looking for more specific results or only articles talking specifically about what I’m researching for, this might be less convenient. Regarding Ask, rather than lists of 
      articles talking about the best search engines, mostly a list of actual search engines popped up, which I found interesting to look through. I also found that Ask doesn’t have any
      headline links for news, shopping, or images provided for your search at the top of the browser, which felt less favorable. The completed search page also did not provide more 
      related searches or phrases, which others might find less convenient, having the interface be less interactive. In conclusion, I found Google and Bing to be the most useful,
      accessible, and versatile search engines.
      
      For activity 2, I completed a Boolean search, which is a way of using search engines to gain more specific results containing key words, or eliminating words you don’t want to
      see. I used google advanced search. Words like AND, OR, NOT, and the symbol - have to be included in your search, filtering out specific words of phrases. For my search I was
      interested to find different cat breeds, but didn't want to see information about one specific breed. My search came out to be “fluffy white cat fluffy OR white OR cat "cat" 
      -ragdoll”. The results gave me a list of articles that talked about different white and fluffy cats, and reading through a few articles, ragdoll cats were not included in them, 
      as my search filtered out the word.</p>
