    <p>During these activities, I learned how to create an HTML ordered and unordered list. I also learned about the href tag, the a tag, and how they are used to integrate urls and 
      allow you to navigate through them. I also learned about other tags, such as ul, ol, li, and others that are used to define different types of lists and identify listed 
        items you might be implementing. This taught me a lot about how structure and organization within your files is important for the functionality and readability of your web page. 
        In the future I will use this information to determine how I want information to be organized and listed my web page.</p>
